# ðŸš€ Wix Astro Blog Template

This project is based on the official [Astro Blog template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog) and integrates it with [**Wix Headless**](https://dev.wix.com/docs/go-headless). This is done using `@wix/astro` which allows managing content and fetching blog posts through Wix Blog, while serving a high-performance static Astro site.

With this template, you get:

- **The flexibility of Astro** â€“ the official blog template including all features (minimality, performance, SEO-friendly, sitemap, RSS).
- **Wix Blog as a headless CMS** â€“ create and manage posts, draft posts, categories and tags directly with the Wix Dashboard.

## ðŸ“¥ Installation & Setup

All you need to do is running the following command:

```bash
npm create @wix/edge@latest -- --template https://github.com/wix-incubator/headless-templates/tree/main/astro/blog
```
